Conventions
"""""""""""


We adopt the following system for branching and merging:

* master branch: 

  * only for complete use case descriptions (corrections/changes are handled in hotfix branches)
  * numbered releases of the code
  * Never edited
  * Merged from issue and hotfix branches
  * Long living

* `issue<NNN>_<short-heading>`

  * ideas for new use cases should be described in regular issues (at https://github.com/metno/use-cases-for-S-ENDA/issues). They can be simple one line, or more elaborate, descriptions
  * for each issue, we create issue branches in which the respective issue is solved and reviewed
  * an issue branch is an issue specific branch (NNN = issue number)
  * Main working area
  * Short living
  * Branched from, and merged back into master

* `hotfix<NNN>_<short-heading>`

  * branches that are specific to an existing use case, i.e., deals with changes on complete use cases that are present in the master branch


.. note::

   * Never edit code in the master branch. Always make a new branch for your edits.
   * A new branch should be very specific to only one problem. It should be short living.
   * Commit often.
   * Branch often.
   * Branch only from master.
   * Create pull requests for your branches and always assign a reviewer to merge, delete the branch, and close the issue (this is easy in github)


The master branch is linked from readthedocs, and shall be complete, nice and understandable.

.. note::

    Please use English language for the use case descriptions
